.SH NAME
.PP
Image\_name \- short description


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Describe how image is used (user app, service, base image, builder image, etc.), the services or features it provides, and environment it is intended to run in (stand\-alone docker, atomic super\-privileged, oc multi\-container app, etc.).


.SH USAGE
.PP
Describe how to run the image as a container and what factors might influence the behavior of the image itself. Provide specific command lines that are appropriate for how the container should be run. Here is an example for a container image meant to be run by the atomic command:

.PP
To pull the container and set up the host system for use by the XYZ container, run:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# atomic install XYZimage

.fi
.RE

.PP
To run the XYZ container (after it is installed), run:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# atomic run XYZimage

.fi
.RE

.PP
To remove the XYZ container (not the image) from your system, run:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# atomic uninstall XYZimage

.fi
.RE

.PP
Also, describe default configuration options (when defined): hostname, domainname, user ID run as, exposed ports, volumes, working directory, command run by default, etc.


.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
Explain all environment variables available to run the image in different ways without the need of rebuilding the image. Change variables on the docker command line with \-e option. For example:

.PP
MYSQL\_PASSWORD=mypass
                The password set for the current MySQL user.


.SH SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
.PP
If you expose ports or run with privileges, note those and provide an explanation. For example:

.PP
\-d
     Runs continuously as a daemon process in the background

.PP
\-p 3306:3306
     Opens  container  port  3306  and  maps it to the same port on the Host.
